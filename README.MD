# Prerequisites
- Graduation from the `PowerShell Foundation workshop` (or equivalent knowledge):
Participants should have completed a foundational workshop or training program focused on PowerShell. This ensures that they have a basic understanding of PowerShell's core concepts, cmdlets, variables, loops, and conditional statements. Alternatively, participants should possess equivalent knowledge gained through practical experience or self-study.
- Experience with `PowerShell` or other scripting languages:
Participants should have prior experience working with PowerShell or other scripting languages such as `Python`, `Bash`, or `Ruby`. This experience includes familiarity with scripting concepts, basic syntax, and common scripting tasks like variable assignment, function definition, and control flow structures.
   
Having these prerequisites in place ensures that participants have a solid foundation in PowerShell and scripting, enabling them to grasp the advanced topics covered in the modules effectively.
